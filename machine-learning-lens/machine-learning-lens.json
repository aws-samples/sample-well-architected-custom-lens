For example:\n• If a model is used to support customer acquisition: How many new customers are acquired and what is their spend when the model's advice is used compared with a baseline?\n• If a model is used to predict when maintenance is needed: What savings are being made by optimizing the maintenance cycle?\nEffective reporting compares the value delivered by an ML model against the ongoing runtime cost and to take appropriate action. If the ROI is substantially positive, are there ways in which this might be scaled to similar challenges, for example. If the ROI is negative, could this be addressed by remedial action, such as reducing the model latency by using serverless inference, or reducing the run time cost by changing the compromise between model accuracy and model complexity, or layering in an additional simpler model to triage or filter the cases that are submitted to the full model.",
